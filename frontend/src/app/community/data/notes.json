        "text": "# Chemical Bonding\n\nChemical bonding is the process where atoms combine to form molecules or compounds. The two main types of chemical bonds are:\n\n- **Ionic Bonds:** Formed by the transfer of electrons between a metal and a nonmetal.\n- **Covalent Bonds:** Formed by the sharing of electrons between two nonmetals.\n\n#### Example: Formation of Sodium Chloride (NaCl)\n\nSodium (Na) loses one electron to form a positive ion (Na+), and Chlorine (Cl) gains one electron to form a negative ion (Cl-). The oppositely charged ions attract each other, forming an ionic bond.",

        "text": "## Photosynthesis: How Plants Make Food\n\n**Photosynthesis** is the remarkable process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. It involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a byproduct.\n\n**The Photosynthesis Equation:**\n\n```\n6CO2 + 6H2O + Light Energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2\n```\n\n**Stages of Photosynthesis:**\n\n1. **Light-dependent Reactions:** Occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. Chlorophyll absorbs light energy, which is used to split water molecules and produce ATP and NADPH.\n2. **Light-independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle):** Occur in the stroma of chloroplasts. ATP and NADPH are used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.\n\n**Importance of Photosynthesis:**\n\n-   Produces food (glucose) for plants and other organisms.\n-   Releases oxygen into the atmosphere, which is essential for most life forms.\n-   Helps regulate the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide.",

        "title": "Introduction to Calculus: Limits and Derivatives",
        "text": "## Calculus: Limits and Derivatives\n\nCalculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with continuous change. It has two main branches:\n\n- **Differential Calculus:** Studies rates of change and slopes of curves using derivatives.\n- **Integral Calculus:** Studies the accumulation of quantities and areas under curves using integrals.\n\n### Limits\n\nA limit describes the behavior of a function as its input approaches a certain value. It is written as:\n\n```\nlim (x→a) f(x) = L\n```\n\nThis means that the value of f(x) gets arbitrarily close to L as x gets closer to a.\n\n### Derivatives\n\nThe derivative of a function measures the instantaneous rate of change of the function with respect to its input. It is denoted as f'(x) or dy/dx.\n\n**Example:**\n\nThe derivative of f(x) = x² is f'(x) = 2x. This represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve of f(x) at any point x.",

        "text": "## The French Revolution (1789-1799)\n\nThe French Revolution was a period of radical social and political upheaval in France that had a major impact on Europe and the world. \n\n### Causes:\n\n- **Social Inequality:** French society was divided into three estates, with the clergy and nobility enjoying privileges while the Third Estate (commoners) bore the brunt of taxation.\n- **Economic Crisis:** France was deeply in debt due to extravagant spending by the monarchy and costly wars.\n- **Enlightenment Ideas:** Philosophers like Rousseau and Montesquieu promoted ideas of liberty, equality, and popular sovereignty.\n- **Weak Leadership:** King Louis XVI was an indecisive ruler who failed to address the growing discontent.\n\n### Key Events:\n\n- **Storming of the Bastille (July 14, 1789):** Symbolized the beginning of the revolution.\n- **Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (August 1789):** Proclaimed fundamental rights and freedoms.\n- **Reign of Terror (1793-1794):** A period of mass executions led by the radical Jacobins.\n- **Rise of Napoleon Bonaparte:** A military general who seized power in 1799 and established the French Empire.\n\n### Consequences:\n\n- **End of the Monarchy:** France became a republic.\n- **Spread of Revolutionary Ideas:** Inspired movements for change across Europe.\n- **Rise of Nationalism:** Fostered a sense of national identity among the French people.",

Found near the equator.\n- **Temperate Forest:** Experiences four distinct seasons, moderate rainfall, and deciduous trees that shed their leaves in the fall.\n- **Desert:** Receives very little rainfall and has extreme temperature fluctuations. Plants and animals are adapted to conserve water.\n- **Grassland:** Dominated by grasses and has few trees. Supports large herds of grazing animals.\n- **Tundra:** Extremely cold and dry biome with permafrost (permanently frozen soil). Found in the Arctic and on high mountaintops.\n- **Taiga (Boreal Forest):** The largest land biome, characterized by long, cold winters and short, cool summers.
