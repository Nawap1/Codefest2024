An engineer while constructing \\nvarious structures must face a number of soil related problems.\\n\\uf0d8The stability of various construction is affected by engineering properties and \\ncharacteristics of soil. \\n\\uf0d8It is necessary to study behavior of the soil and its interactions with the structure to \\nensure its stability. \\n\\nImportance of Soil Mechanics\\n1. Foundations\\n• All foundations for any structure that a civil \\nengineer constructs are bound to rest on the \\nsoil. \\n• The bigger the building or structure, the \\nbigger its foundation \\n• Consequently the more important it is for a \\ncivil engineer to take into consideration the \\nsoil mechanics of the site. \\n\\n• Hard soil with sufficient strength allows an engineer \\nto use shallow foundations, and the weak soil will \\nneed deep foundations to provide robust support for \\nthe structure being constructed.\\n• The choice of foundation is dependent at the depth \\nat which suitable stratum is found.\\nShallow Foundation\\nDeep Foundation\\n\\n2. Earthen Dams\\n• Dam construction provide water for domestic use \\nall year round, support irrigation and also used for \\nhydroelectric power generation.\\n• A proper design is necessary to ensure that they can \\nwithstand the pressure from water and other \\nelements in order to serve their purpose for a long \\ntime without any incidents. \\n• Understanding soil mechanics will ensure that any \\ncivil engineer carrying out such a project takes into \\nconsideration soil properties such as its density, \\npermeability, \\nparticle \\nsize \\ndistribution, \\nconsolidation and compaction characteristics, and \\nshear strength parameter under to come up with a \\nsolid structure. \\n\\n3. Embankments and Excavations\\n• Embankment refers to piling and excavation refers to \\nremoval of huge masses of soil.\\n• Embankments are usually constructed to raise the level \\nof a road, railway or land above ground level or flooding \\nlevel. \\n• Excavation is carried when it is required to construct \\nfoundation, construct basement, construct roads, \\nconstruct canals, lay drainage pipes, construct trench to \\nstudy soil profile, construct borrow pit and to extract \\nresources like oil, coal etc.\\n• Being aware and able to factor things such as slope \\nstability, compaction of soil as well as aspects such as \\neffects of soil seepage, design of support system like \\nbracing system, sheet pile etc. all contribute to stability \\nof embankment and excavation slopes.\\n\\nEmbankment\\nExcavation\\nExcavation for trench\\n\\n4. Retaining structure and Underground structures\\n\\uf0d8Retaining Structure\\n• The role of retaining structure is to retain the soil and \\nprevent it from spreading laterally.\\n• They are commonly used to accommodate changes in \\ngrade, provide increase in right-of-way and buttress the \\ntoe of slopes.\\n• The various types of retaining walls constructed are \\nGravity retaining walls, Cantilever retaining walls, Gabion \\nretaining walls etc.\\n•  The retaining walls, whether made of compacted soil or \\nconcrete, should also be designed accordingly having \\ntaken into consideration the soil mechanics that will be at \\nplay depending on the given surroundings soil type.\\n\\n• The retaining wall should be capable of supporting both the \\nweight of the wall and the force resulting from the earth \\npressure acting upon it without: - \\n\\uf0fcOverturning and \\n\\uf0fcBearing capacity failure \\n\\uf0fcSliding of the wall   \\n\\uf0fcUndue settlement\\n• The reasons for failures might be due to saturated backfill \\nand improper drainage behind the wall (lack of weep holes \\nor clogged holes), foundation problems, settlement or \\nexpansion of the soil, overloading of the wall, construction \\nerrors, lack of passive support, and/or other design errors.\\n\\n\\uf0d8Underground structures\\n• Tunnels, shafts and conduits require evaluation of forces \\nexerted by the soil on these structures.\\n• Today, most urban centres usually construct their infrastructure \\nsuch as gas lines, electricity lines, drainage structures, subways \\nand internet distribution cables underground. \\n• For large urban areas and cities, this can mean digging and \\ntunnelling through miles and miles of heterogeneous soil to be \\nable to reach the millions of houses that make up the city. \\n• The need to understand soil mechanics in such civil engineering \\nworks is more pronounced for these underground projects. \\n• Being able to predict how the soil will behave and affect an \\nunderground pipeline or a subway is important so that the \\ncompleted project can withstand the conditions underground \\nand serve its purpose. \\n\\nFormation of soil\\n• Engineering properties of soils is influenced by how soil is \\nformed.\\n• Knowledge \\nof \\nsoil \\nforming \\nprocess \\ngreatly \\nfacilitate \\nclassification of soil\\n• Exposed rocks are eroded and degraded by various physical and \\nchemical processes like mechanical disintegration, chemical \\ndecomposition or biological weathering.\\n• The products of erosion are picked up and transported to some \\nother place by wind, water etc.\\n• The transported soil are deposited under suitable condition.\\n• Physical and chemical weathering gives two weathering \\nproducts \\n\\uf0d8Mobile ones which are transported over varying distances \\nunder the action of gravity, wind, erosion by water \\n\\uf0d8Residual products that remain on the site of destruction of the \\nparents rocks. \\n\\nFormation of soil\\nA. Physical Weathering\\n• It is natural process of disintegration of rocks into smaller \\nfragments and particles without including any chemical \\nchange in the end product. \\n• Physical weathering is a process of fragmentation of rock \\ndue to some physical forces associated with the factors like \\nfluctuations in temperature, change in the pressure, \\ngrowth of crystals, freezing of water, frost action etc. \\n• The main agents involved are wind, running water and \\nglacier.\\n• The products formed are mainly coarse soils.\\n\\nFormation of soil\\nFactors contributing to Physical weathering \\n• The periodic contraction and expansion of rock \\ndue to variation in temperature, results flaking off \\nof the upper layer of rock causing exfoliations of \\nthe rock \\n• Alternation of light and dark minerals, variation in \\nexpansion leads to development of cracks. \\n• Freezing and thawing of water \\n• Roots of plants \\n• Movement of capillary water \\n• Crystallizations of minerals \\n\\nFormation of soil\\nB. Chemical Weathering\\n• It is the process of alteration of rocks of the earth’s crust by \\nchemical decomposition of rocks \\n• It is due to the effect of : carbonation and dissolution, \\nhydrolysis, oxidation, and hydration. \\n• The end product invariably has a different chemical \\ncomposition and poorer physical constitution as compared to \\nthe parent rock. \\n• It has been observed that water play as an important role in \\nchemical weathering as water can dissolve many active gases \\nfrom the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, \\nhydrogen etc. \\n• The results of chemical weathering are generally fine soils \\nwith altered mineral grains. \\n\\n\\uf071Carbonation and Dissolution\\n• As rain goes through the air and into the \\nground, it grabs carbon dioxide, creating \\ncarbonic acid. \\n• This weak acid reacts with the calcium \\ncarbonate in rocks and dissolves it when it \\nseeps into the cracks. \\n• CO2 + H2O = H2CO3 \\n• CaCO3 + H2CO3 = 2HCO3\\n- + 2Ca2\\n+ \\n\\n\\uf071Hydrolysis\\n• The term hydrolysis combines the prefix hydro, referring \\nto water, with lysis, which is derived from a Greek word \\nmeaning to loosen or dissolve. \\n• Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction where water loosens the \\nchemical bonds within a mineral and produce new \\ncompounds which tend to be softer and weaker than the \\noriginal parent rock material. \\n• This might sound the same as dissolution but the \\ndifference is that hydrolysis produces a different mineral \\nin addition to ions. \\n• An example of hydrolysis is when water reacts with \\npotassium feldspar to produce clay minerals and ions. \\n2KAlSi3O8 + 3H2O = Al2Si2O5(OH)4 + 4Si02 + 2K+ + 2OH-\\n\\n\\uf071Oxidation\\n• Oxidation is another kind of chemical weathering \\nthat occurs when oxygen combines with another \\nsubstance and creates compounds called oxides.\\n• When rocks, particularly those with iron in them, \\nare exposed to air and water, the iron undergoes \\noxidation, which can weaken the rocks and make \\nthem crumble.\\n• Addition of oxygen results in less stable crystal \\nand \\nthus subjected \\nto \\ndisintegration and \\ndecomposition.\\n\\n\\uf071Hydration\\n• Hydration is a type of chemical weathering \\nwhere water reacts chemically with the rock, \\nmodifying its chemical structure. \\n• A consequence of hydration is that the resulting \\nmineral has a greater volume than the original \\nmineral. \\n• The increase in volume creates stress thus \\napplying force to an overlying layer/underlying \\nlayer and breaking it into pieces. \\n\\nFormation of soil\\nC. Biological Weathering\\n• It is the disintegration or decay of rocks and \\nminerals caused by chemical or physical agents of \\norganisms. \\n• Examples: organic activity from lichen and algae, \\nrock disintegration by plant or root growth, \\nburrowing and tunnelling organisms, and acid \\nsecretion. \\n• Organic soil is formed as a result of biological \\nweathering which is highly compressible and is \\nunsuitable for foundation material.\\n\\n• The soil is called Transported soil if the \\nproducts of rock weathering are transported \\nfrom the place where they originated and re-\\ndeposited to any other place. \\n• The soil is called Residual soil if the products \\nof rock weathering are still located at the \\nplace where they originated.\\nTypes of Soils on basis of origin\\nTypes of Soils on basis of size\\n• Coarse grained soil (> 0.075 mm)\\n• Fine grained soil (< 0.075 mm)\\n\\nTypes of transported soils\\n• Glacial soils: \\n \\nFormed by transportation and deposition of glaciers.\\n• Alluvial soils: \\n \\nTransported by running water and deposited along streams.\\n• Lacustrine soils: \\n \\nFormed by deposition in quiet lakes \\n•  Marine soils: \\n \\nFormed by deposition in the seas \\n• Aeolian soils: \\n \\nTransported and deposited by the wind\\n• Colluvial soils: \\n \\nFormed by movement of soil from its original place by gravity,    \\nsuch as during landslide \\n\\nResidual Soil Vs Transported Soil\\nResidual Soil\\nTransported Soil\\nThese soils are found at the same location \\nwhere they have originated\\nThe rock materials are weathered and \\nthen they are moved from their original \\nlocation to a new place by one or more \\nerosion agents to form transported soils\\nThe parent material is the original \\nbedrock\\nThe parent material is different from the \\nunderlying bedrock\\nThe soil has the minerals similar to those \\nin the bed rock\\nThe soil will have a mineral composition \\ndifferent from that of the bedrock\\n\\nRock Cycle\\n\\n• Exposed rocks eroded and degraded by various \\nphysical and chemical process.\\n• Product of erosion picked up by various agencies of \\ntransportation like wind, water\\n• The erosion products are carried out to new \\nlocations where they get deposited.\\n• This shifting of material causes upheavals at the \\ndeposited location after some time.\\n• The cycle is repeated again\\nSoil Formation cycle\\n',\n",

       "'Title: Canvas with React.js\\n\\nLucas Miranda\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n--\\n\\n12\\n\\nListen\\n\\nShare\\n\\nIn this article, we will see how to create a Canvas React component and a custom hook for extracting its logic, so we can just draw inside it like we usually draw in a regular canvas html element.\\n\\nThis article is based on Corey’s article “Animating a Canvas with React Hooks”. Any other sources and related contents are linked throughout this article.\\n\\nI am assuming that you already know canvas, but if you don’t know yet, I recommend this tutorial from MDN to you.\\n\\nIn order to see what we are doing, let’s create a new react app with create-react-app (feel free to skip this step if you are already familiar with React and create-react-app). You can start a new project by running npx create-react-app example or yarn create react-app example if you prefer yarn. If you open the project folder (example) in your code editor, you must get something like this:\\n\\nWe don’t need all these files, so we will delete almost everything from src folder and public folder. We just need the index.html, App.js and index.js like you can see there:\\n\\nWe will also keep only the essential in the index.js script and index.html markup file.\\n\\nIf we run yarn start or npm start we can see the “hello world” in the page. So, it is working!\\n\\nNow that we see it is all working, we can replace the “hello world” with the Canvas component that we will create.\\n\\nOur app crash, but it will get fixed when we create the Canvas component.\\n\\nWe need a canvas element to draw inside it, so we must create a component that is basically a canvas element:\\n\\nNow we have a canvas element wrapped in a react component called Canvas. Great! However, how can we draw in it? Well… we will need to get the DOM canvas element itself to get its context object, right? The React way to get a dom element is by giving it a ref prop.\\n\\nTo get the canvas element, we will create a ref and give it to the canvas element:\\n\\nWe can access the canvas element through the canvasRef now. Now we just need to get the context and start drawing! 🙌\\n\\nWhat? Is it broken? Cannot read property getContext of null? getContext is not a function? 😓\\n\\nThe component is not mounted yet when we tried to get the canvas through the ref, so its value is, naturally, the initial value that we gave for it (which is null in my case). We must wait the component did mount properly before get the real canvas. Fortunately, there is a hook to handle that problem!\\n\\nThe useEffect hook allow us to perform side effects in function components. It means that we can call functions right after the component did mount, component update or change of some variable, and some other stuff. (Learn more about useEffect hook here and life cycle of components here)\\n\\nWe are interested in the first case right now: the component did mount. Right after the canvas element is available in the dom for us, we want to get it on javascript to take its context and make some draw. To do that, we pass a function to be executed as the first argument of the useEffect, and an empty array as the second. The empty array says to useEffect that we want execute that function only once, after the component did mount (we will discuss more about this array later). If we pass only the first argument (the function), useEffect will call the function after every single update of the component.\\n\\nNow we are able to draw in the canvas! 🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉\\n\\nWe have a black rectangle in our canvas right now, but we don’t wanna draw a black rectangle every single time we use this component, right? Then, we can take a callback function that make our draw, so our component can be more dynamic. Let’s do it!\\n\\nYou may notice that now we have changed the array as the second argument of the useEffect, right? Now it is no longer empty. We have put the draw function inside it. Do you remember that I said that useEffect could call functions after a change of some variable? This is the case. That array is known as the dependencies array, and everything we put in it, is watched by the useEffect. When anything that is inside of the dependencies array changes, the function will be called again with its updated values. Thus, every time we change the draw, the function of the useEffect will be called again for the new draw.\\n\\nWe have a draw function instead of a bunch of code spread in our useEffect callback now. Nevertheless, we still have a screen with a static draw on it. How about adding some animation to it?\\n\\nNow we have a simple animation!\\n\\nLet me explain what happened here:\\n\\nLooks good, don’t you think? But defining the draw function inside the component doesn’t sounds good… I mean, we still have the same draw for every canvas! 🤔\\n\\nI can see you yelling to me: “TAKE THE DRAW CALLBACK FROM PROPS!!”\\n\\nKeep calm young one, that is exactly what we’re gonna do right now 😎\\n\\nWe should insert the draw function in the Canvas component right now:\\n\\nIt looks great now 🧐. All we need is to use the Canvas component giving the draw function as a prop to it and we have a complete canvas animated.\\n\\nBut… What if we want to make a different component, with some little changes, but keeping the same logic for the canvas? To achieve that, we should create a custom hook for our canvas, then we can use the logic in our canvas, and if we want to create some different component, but keeping the logic, we can just call the hook for handle the logic for us.\\n\\nNote that the only thing we need to give to our logic is the draw callback, and the only thing we have to pass to our component is the canvasRef. Therefore, our component must be something like that in the end:\\n\\nThe draw callback is given to our hook and a ref for our canvas element is returned. Now we just have to copy our logic to the useCanvas hook and transform it in a function that receives the draw callback and return the canvasRef:\\n\\nNow we are (almost) done!\\n\\nWhat if you want to use another context instead of 2d in the canvas? If you have some other configurations that you want for your canvas? Then you might want make the Canvas component more flexible by giving it one more prop: options.\\n\\nThe options prop might be an object which contains all your custom setup for the canvas and whatever you want to your Canvas component. Your canvas hook also must have a little modification ir order to accept new arguments.\\n\\nMaking the code falls back to the tradicional setup will provide a better usability. With that you can setup a webgl context.\\n\\nAt this moment, we don’t have control over the canvas size. What happen if we want a bigger or a smaller canvas? Or even a canvas with dynamic adjustable height and width? We should have a function to handle that.\\n\\nHere I will show how you could track the canvas size, but you can come with a different approach that you prefer for this function.\\n\\nThis way you are able to set the size of your canvas using only CSS, and your draw will not look distorted. You can call this function before the draw function or even inside it.\\n\\nYou may think that the resize function isn’t doing anything at all, but without it your canvas will keep the same initial logical size, therefore, the space used to draw (canvas logical size) can be bigger or smaller than the size being displayed (canvas style size) and you will have trouble because canvas will scale the draw to fit the whole displayed canvas. You can learn more about logical size and CSS size of the canvas here and here.\\n\\nWhen your canvas is running in some device with high pixel density like modern smartphones, the draw can look blurry. To avoid that, you must define the size of your canvas according on the device pixel ratio.\\n\\nHere we rewrite the resize canvas function to take into account the device pixel ratio. It is necessary to scale to the ratio to draw with the actual CSS pixels. Learn more about correcting resolution in a canvas here.\\n\\nIn the draw function, there is some procedures that we might want execute for every animation, like clear the canvas or increment the frame counter. We could abstract this procedures to special functions that will be executed before and after the draw: the predraw and postdraw functions. This way we can write less code every time we want to create a different animation. These functions must be called (obviously) inside of the render function, before and after the draw function.\\n\\nWe could just drop the code of these functions in the render function, but writing in functions will allow us to replace them by taking them from props in the component like that:\\n\\nNote that you still should make some modification in the useCanvas hook in order to accept the predraw and postdraw function. You can modularize it in the way that attends you!\\n\\nWell, that is it! Now you have what is needed to make a complete Canvas component with custom hooks for making animations, static draws or even mini-games. 🎉🎊🎊🎉✨🏆'"
